The course approach will involve in-class presentations, project work, field trips and case studies. WebCT will be used to expand the student\u2019s access to course materials and allow for a measure of distance learning.

Each topic will be introduced and developed utilizing seminal articles in the literature as well as excerpts from texts and further discussion on current problems and state-of-the-art experimental techniques will draw on the current scientific literature.", "is_comm_intense": false, "min_credits": 3, "grade_type": "", "number": 4660, "max_credits": 3, "prereqs": "Prerequisites: Senior standing or permission of instructor.", "department_id": 148, "id": 14849, "name": "Muscle Mechanics and Modeling"}, {"description": "", "is_comm_intense": false, "min_credits": 1, "grade_type": "", "number": 4940, "max_credits": 8, "prereqs": "None", "department_id": 148, "id": 8643, "name": "Studies in Biomedical Engineering"}, {"description": "", "is_comm_intense": false, "min_credits": 1, "grade_type": "", "number": 4940, "max_credits": 8, "prereqs": "None", "department_id": 148, "id": 9547, "name": "Studies in Biomedical Engineering"}, {"description": "", "is_comm_intense": false, "min_credits": 1, "grade_type": "", "number": 4940, "max_credits": 8, "prereqs": "None", "department_id": 148, "id": 10483, "name": "Studies in Biomedical Engineering"}, {"description": "", "is_comm_intense": false, "min_credits": 1, "grade_type": "", "number": 4940, "max_credits": 8, "prereqs": "None", "department_id": 148, "id": 11430, "name": "Studies in Biomedical Engineering"}, {"description": "", "is_comm_intense": false, "min_credits": 1, "grade_type": "", "number": 4940, "max_credits": 8, "prereqs": "None", "department_id": 148, "id": 12374, "name": "Studies in Biomedical Engineering"}, {"description": "", "is_comm_intense": false, "min_credits": 1, "grade_type": "", "number": 4940, "max_credits": 8, "prereqs": "None", "department_id": 148, "id": 13400, "name": "Studies in Biomedical Engineering"}, {"description": "", "is_comm_intense": false, "min_credits": 1, "grade_type": "", "number": 4940, "max_credits": 8, "prereqs": "None", "department_id": 148, "id": 14748, "name": "Studies in Biomedical Engineering"}, {"description": "", "is_comm_intense": false, "min_credits": 1, "grade_type": "", "number": 4940, "max_credits": 8, "prereqs": "None", "department_id": 148, "id": 15845, "name": "Studies in Biomedical Engineering"}, {"description": "", "is_comm_intense": false, "min_credits": 3, "grade_type": "", "number": 4960, "max_credits": 3, "prereqs": "", "department_id": 148, "id": 10149, "name": "MECHANOBIOLOGY"}, {"description": "", "is_comm_intense": false, "min_credits": 3, "grade_type": "", "number": 4960, "max_credits": 3, "prereqs": "", "department_id": 148, "id": 12032, "name": "MECHANOBIOLOGY"}, {"description": "", "is_comm_intense": false, "min_credits": 3, "grade_type": "", "number": 4960, "max_credits": 3, "prereqs": "", "department_id": 148, "id": 12944, "name": "MECHANOBIOLOGY"}, {"description": "", "is_comm_intense": false, "min_credits": 3, "grade_type": "", "number": 4960, "max_credits": 3, "prereqs": "", "department_id": 148, "id": 16630, "name": "PRODUCT DEV & COMM"}, {"description": "", "is_comm_intense": false, "min_credits": 3, "grade_type": "", "number": 4961, "max_credits": 3, "prereqs": "", "department_id": 148, "id": 9596, "name": "BIOLOGICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS"}, {"description": "", "is_comm_intense": false, "min_credits": 3, "grade_type": "", "number": 4961, "max_credits": 3, "prereqs": "", "department_id": 148, "id": 10277, "name": "BIOMATERIALS APPS.
