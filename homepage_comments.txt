Homepage
-----------
Main page:
	-A few pixels padding around the logo, so it doesn't blend
	into the header bar

Signup form issues:
	-Needs username field
	-Needs password confirmation
	-Are we keeping first/last name?
		-If so, should we auto-detect it using the E-Mail and the RPI Directory API?
		(https://github.com/jewishdan18/RPI-Directory/wiki/API-Documentation)
		(see Directory_API_Test.js for sample code for this)
	-What's the invitation code?
